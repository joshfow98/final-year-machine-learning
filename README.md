# final-year-machine-learning
This is the code containing an algorithm which can be used to create a machine learning model for my final year project.

My final year project combines multiple areas of current study, which are containerization, machine learning and automated pipelines. The aim of the project is to provide a Proof of Concept (POC) that a machine learning model, can be containerized through an automated deployment pipeline into a web-api which can be accessed by the end users.

This repository contains ony the code for the machine learning algorithm
